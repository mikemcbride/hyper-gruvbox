# Hyper Gruvbox

[Hyper](https://hyper.is) theme based on [gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox). There's another gruvbox theme for Hyper but I prefer some of the style choices I made, such as the tab styles.

### Install

Unlike most hyper plugins, I'm not planning on publishing this one. For one, there's already an existing theme like I mentioned above. This is mostly for my own use. That being said, here's how you can use it:

1. Clone (or fork) the repo and get it on your local machine.
1. Symlink the folder (or clone it directly into) your local hyper plugins folder (probably `~/.hyper_plugins/local`)
1. Add it as a local plugin:

  ```js
localPlugins: [
      'hyper-gruvbox'
],
```
4. Fully reload Hyper (`Cmd+Shift+R`) or quit and re-open.
